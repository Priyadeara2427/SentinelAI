## 🔐 Description
Cybersecurity code is a hacker’s playground in today's rising cyber threats. Manual code reviews and security audits are slow, error-prone, and often miss critical vulnerabilities. Developers often unknowingly introduce serious security flaws, from SQL Injections and Hardcoded Secrets to broken authentication and XSS Attacks.

This AI-powered tool brings security to your fingertips — fast, accurate, and real-time.


## 🚀 Features

🔍 **Real-Time Vulnerability Detection**

  - Scans Python, Java, JavaScript, and C/C++ code for issues like SQL injection, XSS, command injection, and buffer overflows.

🧠 **Static Analysis - Python tools**

 - Python Tools used to detect and create vulnerability report - Bandit, Pilint.

🧠 **AI-Powered Security Insights**
 
- Uses Groq's high-speed LLMs (e.g., CodeLama) to analyze code contextually and suggest secure coding practices.

🛡️ **Secure Coding Recommendations**

- Each vulnerability includes severity levels (Low, Medium, High) and actionable remediation tips.

✍️ **Integrated Code Editor**

- Built-in Streamlit editor for instant analysis of pasted or written code — no setup or login required.

## 🛠️ Working

### 1. 📝 User Input
The user can input the source code in two ways:
- Typing or pasting code directly into the real-time code editor built using Streamlit.
- Uploading a file — the file must match the selected language extension in the select language dropdown bar:
  
  - `.py` for Python
    
  - `.java` for Java
    
  - `.js` for JavaScript
    
  - `.cpp`, `.c` for C/C++

### 2. 🌍 Language Detection
- SentinelAI detects the programming language of the input code using libraries like `pygments` or `guesslang`.
  
- This ensures the correct static analysis tool is applied based on the detected language.

### 3. 🧪 Static Analysis
- Once the language is identified, the appropriate static analysis tool is invoked:
  - Python → Bandit, Pylint  
  - JavaScript → ESLint
  - Java → spotbugs 
  - C/C++ → Cppcheck  

- These tools analyze the code for common security vulnerabilities and generate a line-by-line report including:
  - Type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS)
  - Affected line of code
  - Severity level (e.g., High, Medium)
  - Suggested remediation
  - Security score
  - Generate a summary of the vulnerabilities in the code

### 4. 🌐 Multilingual Support
Supports secure code analysis across multiple languages:
- Python  
- JavaScript  
- Java  
- C/C++
  
### 5. 🤖 GenAI Integration (Groq API + DeepSeek Model)
- The report generated by the static analysis is passed to a large language model (LLM) via Groq API using DeepSeek.
- The model responds with:
  
  - A secure version of the affected code
    
  - A human-readable explanation of the vulnerability and the fix
    
- The AI-generated output is streamed in real-time through the user interface.

### 6. 📊 Smart Output
- Presents all detected vulnerabilities with:
  
  - Type, severity, affected line, and remediation
    
  - LLM-generated secure code fix and explanation
    
- Displays a message if no issues are found.
  
- All results are shown in a clear, user-friendly UI built with Streamlit.
